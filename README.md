# Numerical Modelling

Most of my major coding-based work has been used for forward modelling and numerical modelling. 
Specifically, I work on 2 projects: 1) Forward modelling of the Martian hydrological cycle and 2) Numerical solutions to complex systems of ODEs related to isotopic exchanges. 

Both of these modelling projects are currently being incorporated into papers, so code samples are not available for public yet.

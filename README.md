# Numerical Modelling

Most of my major coding-based work has been used for forward modelling and numerical modelling. 
Specifically, I work on 2 projects: 
1) Forward modelling of the Martian hydrological cycle, the model code is hosted here: https://data.caltech.edu/records/1879
2) Numerical solutions to complex systems of ODEs related to isotopic exchanges that is currently being incorporated into a paper.
